## Install


Install dependencies:

```
$ make install
```

## Run development

Start dev server:

```
$ make serve
```

that's it. Open [http://localhost:5001/](http://localhost:5001/)(if you use default port) at your browser. Now you ready to start coding your awesome project.

## Build

Install dependencies and type `NODE_ENV=production make build`. This rule is producing webpack build and regular golang build after that. Result you can find at `$GOPATH/bin`. Note that the binary will be named **as the current project directory**.
